      <h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Steve Job's life:</h2>
      <ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
        <br>
        <li><b>1955</b> - Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, and was adopted by Paul
          and Clara Jobs. He grew up with one sister, Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a hobby.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1972</b> - After graduating from high school in 1972, Jobs attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, for
          two years. He dropped out after one semester to visit India and study eastern religions in the summer of 1974.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1975</b> - In 1975 Jobs joined a group known as the Homebrew Computer Club. One member, a technical whiz
          named Steve Wozniak, was trying to build a computer. Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew
          Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple
          computer.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1976</b> - In 1976 he and Wozniak formed their own company. They called it Apple Computer Company, in
          memory of a happy summer Jobs had spent picking apples. They raised $1,300 in startup money by selling Jobs's
          microbus and Wozniak's calculator. At first they sold circuit boards (the boards that hold the internal
          components of a computer) while they worked on the computer prototype (sample).</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1984</b> - In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh. The on-screen display had
          small pictures called icons. To use the computer, the user pointed at an icon and clicked a button using a new
          device called a mouse. This process made the Macintosh very easy to use. The Macintosh did not sell well to
          businesses, however. It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high quality
          printer.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1985</b> - The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Jobs resigned
          in 1985 from the company he had helped found, though he retained his title as chairman of its board of
          directors.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1988</b> - Jobs soon hired some of his former employees to begin a new computer company called NeXT. Late
          in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced at a large gala event in San Francisco, aimed at the educational
          market. Initial reactions were generally good. The product was very user-friendly, and had a fast processing
          speed, excellent graphics displays, and an outstanding sound system. Despite the warm reception, however, the
          NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a black-and-white screen, and could not be linked to
          other computers or run common software.</li>
        <br>
      </ul>

      <p class="font"><i>I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry. There
          weren't many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from
          mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one was really in it for the money...
          There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great companies, well, that's not
          what they're about."</i>
